# pact-spring-boot-example

This project is an example implementation of contract testing with [Pact](https://pact.io/)
and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Running the build

Run ```mvn clean install``` on the command line from the project's root folder.

This will build the **orchestration** Maven project and its modules **consumer** and **producer** (in that order, which
is relevant here, because the producer tests use the **pacts** generated by the consumer tests).

As is usual with Maven, building the project will execute the tests for each of its modules.

The tests in the consumer module will create a folder `target/pact` in the project's root folder and store the pacts
generated by the *Pact* consumer tests in that folder.

The *Pact* provider (*Pact* uses that term synonymously with "producer") tests in the producer module in turn will use
the pacts from that folder to verify the provider's responses.

## Infrastructure

In addition to the *Pact* tests and the file-based standalone configuration used by those, the project also provides
an `infrastructure` directory which contains a sample Docker setup for running
a [Pact Broker](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact_broker)
with a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database as its data store.

## Built With

* [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)
* [Pact](https://pact.io/)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
